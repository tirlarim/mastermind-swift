# Mastermind iOS Game

## Overview

Welcome to the iOS version of the classic code-breaking game Mastermind, developed using Swift and UIKit.
This game challenges players to guess the secret color code in the fewest attempts possible.
Each guess is met with feedback to help narrow down the possibilities.

## Game Rules
